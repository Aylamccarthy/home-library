## Strategy/Scope

I chose to develop an application that can be used in real life. Home Library App allows users to manage their personal/family book libraries. The application offers functionalities such as: viewing book database, adding, editing and removing books.

The application should have a clean and intuitive user interface and offer easy access and navigation to all functionalities.

To achieve the strategy goals, I implemented the following features:

- Customised terminal display page for better visual experience.
- Colours in terminal to give user feedback dependent on his actions.
- Reliable and quick connection with database provided by Google.
- Menu with easy access to all features and possibility to exit or restart the application.
- Clean user interface for easy navigation and readability.
