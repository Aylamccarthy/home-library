The Home Library App was created as Portfolio Project #3 (Python Essentials) for Diploma in Full Stack Software Development at [Code Institute](https://www.codeinstitute.net). It allows users to manage their personal/family book libraries, view, add, update, and remove books.

Project purpose was to build a command-line python application that allows user to manage a common dataset about a particular domain.

## Strategy/Scope

I chose to develop an application that can be used in real life. This idea came to mind when I was brainstorming on what app to develop to help my life as a parent taking care of a young family. Initially I thought about a weekly grocery shopping list app, but when I saw our books all over the house, that's when I decided, an app to manage these books would be perfect! Home Library App was designed to allows users to manage their personal/family book libraries. The application offers functionalities such as: viewing book database, adding, updating and removing books.

The application should have a clean and intuitive user interface and offer easy access and navigation to all functionalities.

To achieve the strategy goals, I implemented the following features:

- Customised terminal display page for better visual experience.
- Colours in terminal to give user feedback dependent on his actions.
- Reliable and quick connection with database provided by Google.
- Menu with easy access to all features and possibility to exit or restart the application.
- Clean user interface for easy navigation and readability.

## Site owner goals

As a program owner/developer I would like to:
- create application that has real life usage,
- create application that is easy to use and intuitive to navigate,
- create application with clean, good looking and accesible interface,
- provide user a feedback to every input and action,
- decide what kind of user input is allowed and valid,
- create bug free application.

##  External user's goal

As a user I would like to:
- be able to clearly understand application's purpose from the first contact,
- be able to use program in real life,
- be able to easily navigate the program and access all features,
- be able to receive feedback to actions taken,
- be able to decide what to do next, what features to use,
- be able to quit program,
- avoid any errors/bugs during using the app.


## Bugs
To print data base using prettytable. I found this bug so challenging but eventually managed to solve it after days of research.
The book IDs in the database would not generate automatically as expected.

Validation on edit_book function is not working as expected

backround image and favicon are not working as expected
